## Pull Requests

We're also happy to take pull requests,
both for fixing bugs/typos
and submitting new remedies.
For larger changes,
it's often best to file an issue for discussion first.

### Organization

The code is organized into:

- A core `remedy.css`
  that we recommend using broadly across most projects.
- A secondary `reminders.css`
  with more opinionated or potentially dangerous remedies
  that should be reviewed and considered on a case-by-case basis.
  All reminders are commented out by default.
- Additional specialized remedy files
  (such as `quotes.css`) that can be used as-needed,
  but may not be useful generally.

The `process` folder contains related materials:

- Other resets
- UA stylesheets from various browsers
- An html file to test against

### Documentation

We're using code comments with
[Doxray](https://github.com/himedlooff/doxray)
to automatically generate our online documentation.
Comments start with `/* @docs`,
and use [YAML](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/) structure,
and [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/)
for notes.
It looks like this:

```css
/* @docs
label: Name The Remedy (required)

note: |
  Indented markdown note can include
  any [links](http://mozilla.org/) and
  *other* `markdown` **syntax** (recommended).

  The vertical bar `|` at the start of the note block
  allows the note to span multiple lines.

links:
  - https://example.com/any-relevant-links-including-github-discussion/
  - https://example.com/links-are-recommended

todo: |
  Add a `markdown` block
  with todo items releated to this remedy.

  - You can add lists in the markdown,
    but this is not the same as the `links` YAML list...
  - (optional)

category: create groups (required)
*/
```

Every file should start with a file-level
comment that describes the purpose
and contents of that file:

```css
/* @docs
label: Name The File (required)
version: 3.0.1-beta.1 (required)

note: |
  Describe the purpose & contents of the file (recommended).

category: file (!important)
```

Adding `category: file` marks it as a file-level comment.
We also include a `version` number on every file,
since CSS documents are likely to be coppied and pasted
out-of-context.
